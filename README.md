<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Vibhuti Ravi 👋</h1>


## 🚀 About Me
🎓 I'm a **Software Engineer** with 2.5 YoE.  
💡 I have a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Over time, I got interested in **network applications** and **software development**.  

Some of my work on here:
- 🎧 Building microservice-based platforms (Docker + Kubernetes, PostgreSQL)
- 🧠 Working with GNNs, medical imaging, and deep learning
- 📡 Exploring 5G MIMO and advanced modulation schemes

I'm currently learning more about cloud infrastructure and system design in my free time.
